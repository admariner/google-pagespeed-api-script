2. Queries each url with the google pagespeed api.
3. Filters JSON results to only include desired metrics.
4. Metrics are saved to local .csv spreadsheet for analysis.


*LOADING URLS TO TEST*
Save a .txt file on your local machine named 'pagespeed.txt', or, create a new name but make sure you change the reference in the script to look for it.
